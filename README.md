# Disaster Tweet Classification with NLP & Machine Learning

An advanced machine learning project that classifies tweets in real-time to determine if they indicate a disaster event. Built using Natural Language Processing (NLP), this project leverages various ML algorithms and a Flask-based web application for easy accessibility and deployment.

##  Features

* Comprehensive NLP Pipeline: Data cleaning, tokenization, vectorization with TF-IDF, and GloVe word embeddings.

* Diverse Model Ensemble: Evaluates multiple models, including Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and more. Gaussian Naive Bayes serves as the final model for classification.

* Sentiment Analysis Integration: Uses VADER and TextBlob to extract sentiment features from tweet text, enhancing prediction accuracy.

* User-Friendly Web Interface: Allows users to input tweet text and receive real-time predictions.

* Developed a web application: Developed a web application using Flask
